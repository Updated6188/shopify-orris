            "question": "What is Orris Eau De Parfume?",
            "answer": "<p>Eau de Parfum (EDP) is a type of fragrance that contains a higher concentration of perfume oils than other types like Eau de Toilette or Eau de Cologne. Typically, Eau de Parfum has a fragrance concentration of around 15% to 30% (we use 30%), making it more long-lasting and stronger.</p><p>Because of its higher concentration, Eau de Parfum lasts longer on the skin, usually between 4 to 6 hours or more, depending on the notes and the individual’s skin chemistry. It strikes a good balance between intensity and wearability, which is why it’s one of the most popular types of fragrance.</p>"
